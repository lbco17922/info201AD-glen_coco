**CONCLUSION**

At first glance, it does not appear that there is a significant worldwide correlation to be made between alcohol consumption per capita, and happiness. However, there are certainly trends to be observed within certain geographical regions, as is seen on the scatter plot visualization. 

Using the World Map Vusualization, different cultures use alchohol for different reasons. America has a high alcholism rate, which could be a contributing factor to why the happiness score is so low. Northern Africa had the highest happiness scores, but they have one of the lowest alcohol consumption scores, so theres not much connections between the two there. Also, in the Middle East there wasn't much correlation with their alcohol consumption and happiness scores. They were mostly in the middle, with some countries like Pakistan, Oman, UAE, and Syria having high scores. 

America and most of the European countries use alcohol on the side for meals, drink at holiday celebrations and other everyday events. Whereas, people not in Western countries most likely don't treat alcohol this way and use it only for big celebrations. A lot of the countries with high alcohol consumption were also countries that legalize alcohol at the age of 18, or have less strict alcohol laws. Almost every country in Asia has a low alcohol consumption- so there wasn't much correlation there with their scattered happiness levels.

Looking at the scatter plot visualization- the Middle East and Northern Africa have high happiness scores and the lowest alcohol per capita- they are happy without alcohol. Although, the graph depicts that even though they're more on the lower alcohol consumption side- they still have a bit of a rise in their happiness score when the alcohol per capita is increased. Same goes with Sub Saharan African regions, their happiness scores seem to be stagnant no matter how much alcohol consumption a country has. On the other hand, European countries, New Zealand, and Australia had higher happiness scores correlating with their high alcohol per capita scores.

There is no apparent correlation between regions happiness scores and alcohol per capita, but there are some fluctuations between certain  regions.
